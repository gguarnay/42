## Overview

Repository of my work during the 42 program, that follows a logical sequence of 17 long-lasting skills that speak to businesses. These skills also have the same fundamental element: personal adaptability, learning, coping and solving new challenges that they will inevitably face regularly. Even if it has a few obligatory paths, 42â€™s program is individually tailored throughout their educational experience. Many classical themes are addressed in order to develop the skills they contain, like:
 - Computer Science / Programming
 - Innovation
 - Infrastructures
 - Personal Development and Expression
 - Entrepreneurship
